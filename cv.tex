\section{About}
I am a Software Development Engineer at intive GmbH, where I leverage my expertise in programming, hardware design, and computer architecture to develop cutting-edge solutions for the automotive industry.

Prior to joining intive, I worked at VECTOR Informatik, where I honed my skills in developing powerful software solutions for the automotive sector. I engaged with C++ and contributed to testing strategies using Google Test, demonstrating my adaptability and commitment to excellence. 

My educational journey began with a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering from Ostbayerische Technische Hochschule Regensburg, which equipped me with a solid understanding of programming, hardware design, and computer architecture. I also expanded my knowledge by pursuing a Master's degree in Bioinformatics at the prestigious Universit채t T체bingen, where I achieved excellent grades before deciding to focus on my professional career.

At intive, I am currently working on "Carmen," a visualization and analysis tool for BMW that facilitates the understanding of internal network communication between different ECUs within a vehicle. Despite the challenges posed by the project's extensive codebase and complex architecture, I am dedicated to delivering innovative solutions and optimizing the tool's performance.

Beyond my professional responsibilities, I am passionate about educating the next generation of students. As a former part-time advanced mathematics tutor, I prepared high school students for their exams, covering a comprehensive curriculum that spans from algebra to calculus. This role perfectly complements my previous experience as a Research Assistant at UKM Universit채tsklinikum M체nster, where I explored the application of cutting-edge technologies like "BERT" to automatically extract knowledge from biomedical research papers.

My emerging technological interests lie in utilizing autonomous humanoid robots to build dirt cheap housing for everyone and longevity research. My ultimate goal is to apply my expertise in a work environment that fosters professional growth and allows me to make a meaningful impact on society and the world.
